      },
      {
        "question": "Can I park my car on the street overnight during the winter?",
        "answer": "No, generally you cannot. The Town's parking by-law (like 2002-85-TR) prohibits parking on any highway (street) between 2:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. from December 1st to March 31st each year.

      },
      {
        "question": "How do I find out the specific zoning for my property?",
        "answer": "The Town's Zoning By-laws (like 72-7 or 87-34) include zoning maps (often called Schedule A). You can usually view these maps at the Town offices or potentially on the Town's website to find the specific zone designation (like R1, C1, etc.) for your property."

Larger 'Day Care Centres' have different rules and may only be allowed in specific zones."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a limit on how many unrelated people can live in one house?",
        "answer": "The definition of 'Family' in the Zoning By-law (like 87-34) often limits the number of unrelated people living together as a single housekeeping unit (sometimes allowing up to two unrelated people in addition to a traditional family). Rooming houses have specific definitions and are only permitted in certain zones."
      },

        "question": "What are the rules for putting up election signs?",
        "answer": "The Sign By-law (like 2002-209-RE, Schedule C) has specific rules for election signs.

A permit and deposit might be needed for signs on municipal property."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can my neighbour store their large RV or boat in their front driveway all year?",
        "answer": "Usually not. The General Zoning By-law (like 87-34) often restricts the outdoor storage of boats, tourist trailers, or similar vehicles in residential zones. Typically, only one such vehicle is allowed, and it must be stored in the rear yard, not the front yard or driveway."
      },

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I install a swimming pool in my side yard?",
        "answer": "Yes, potentially. The General Zoning By-law (like 87-34) usually permits swimming pools in side yards, but they cannot be located closer to the property line than the required setback for the main house. There are also rules about the pool's height relative to the ground."
      },
      {
        "question": "My neighbour's house looks like it's falling apart. What can the Town do?",
        "answer": "The Property Standards By-law (like 98-176-RE) requires all parts of a building to be maintained in a structurally sound condition.

        "answer": "According to the Second Hand Goods By-law (like 2002-201-LI), transient vendors at the Stouffville Country Market are generally exempt from needing a specific Second Hand Vendor licence, but they still need to follow certain rules like keeping records and providing ID if asked by an officer."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often do taxi drivers in Stouffville need to get their vehicles inspected?",
        "answer": "The Taxicab Licensing By-law (like 2004-180-LI) requires taxicabs to meet Safety Standards Certificate requirements. While vehicles generally can't be older than 5 years, extensions might be possible if the owner submits the vehicle for semi-annual inspections and provides current Safety Standards Certificates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can a business put up a big inflatable sign?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with restrictions. The Sign By-law (like 2002-209-RE) usually allows inflatable signs in Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional zones with a permit.

      },
      {
        "question": "My neighbour is draining their pool water onto my property. Is that allowed?",
        "answer": "No. The Property Standards By-law (like 98-176-RE) states that property areas must be graded to prevent drainage issues and that storm-water run-off should be contained within the property limits or directed to an appropriate drainage system (swale, storm sewer). Draining water directly onto an adjacent property is generally not permitted."
      },
      {
        "question": "I'm selling my house. What kind of 'For Sale' sign can I put up?",
        "answer": "The Sign By-law (like 2002-209-RE) permits temporary real estate signs. In residential zones, these signs usually have a size limit (e.g., 0.5 sq metres or about 5 sq feet).

        "question": "Can I record a Town Council meeting?",
        "answer": "Yes, generally. The Procedural By-law (like 2003-187-MS) allows meetings open to the public to be taped, televised, or otherwise recorded, provided it's done from the designated audience area and doesn't disrupt the meeting.

        "question": "Is there a fee to apply for a minor variance from the Committee of Adjustment?",
        "answer": "Yes, there is an application fee for Minor Variances. According to the 2004 Fees By-law (2004-117-FI), the fee was $575.00 at that time. There might also be an additional fee if your property uses private sewage disposal. Check the current fee schedule for the latest costs."

      {
        "question": "What is the penalty for parking illegally in Stouffville, like in a No Parking zone?",

        "question": "Are there specific times when parking is restricted on most streets?",
        "answer": "Yes, besides the winter overnight parking ban (Dec 1 - Mar 31, 2am-5am), the Parking By-law (like 2002-085-TR) often prohibits parking on any street for longer than three (3) consecutive hours at any time, unless signs specifically permit longer parking."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can a business on Main Street put up a projecting sign that hangs over the sidewalk?",
        "answer": "Yes, within limits. The Sign By-law (like 2002-209-RE) has special rules for the B.I.A. District (Schedule B). Projecting signs are allowed but have size restrictions (e.g., max 1.0 sq metre per face) and height requirements (min 2.438m above sidewalk).

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I operate a business like a small engine repair shop out of my garage in a residential area?",
        "answer": "Likely not. While some 'Home Occupations' are permitted under the Zoning By-law (like 87-34), they usually cannot involve mechanical equipment beyond what's normal for domestic use, cannot create noise or smells that disturb neighbours, and cannot involve outdoor storage or significant traffic. A repair shop would likely violate these conditions."

        "question": "Is angle parking allowed anywhere on Main Street?",
        "answer": "You would need to check the specific schedules in the current Parking By-law (like Schedule I in 2002-85-TR). Generally, parking on Main Street is parallel, but specific sections might be designated for angle parking with appropriate signs and markings."

      },
      {
        "question": "My neighbour has a really bright security light that shines right into my bedroom window. Is there a rule about that?",
        "answer": "The Sign By-law (like 2002-209-RE) includes a general provision (Section 4.8) that light sources illuminating signs must be shielded so the light source isn't visible off the property. While this specifically mentions signs, the principle might apply to other nuisance lighting. You could contact By-law Enforcement to inquire about nuisance lighting regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I put up a small sign in my window advertising piano lessons?",
        "answer": "Possibly, but likely not if it's considered a business sign. Home occupations generally cannot have signs (Zoning By-law 87-34).

      },
      {
        "question": "Can a taxi driver charge extra if they have to wait for me?",
        "answer": "Yes. The Taxicab Licensing By-law (like 2004-180-LI) states that for prearranged trips, if the driver notifies the passenger of arrival and waits a reasonable time, they can engage the meter, and the waiting time will be included in the fare according to the approved tariff."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I don't pay my water bill?",
        "answer": "If you don't pay your water bill by the due date, the Waterworks By-law (like 96-187-WS) states a penalty (e.g., 10%) will be applied.

        "question": "Can a store on Main Street have a large flashing neon sign?",
        "answer": "No. The Sign By-law (like 2002-209-RE) prohibits signs with flashing or moving illumination (Section 3a). Additionally, Schedule B for the B.I.A. District often restricts internal illumination for wall and projection signs."

        "answer": "Building permits are required for most construction, including additions, under the Building Code Act and Town bylaws. You can report suspected work being done without a permit to the Town's Building Department or By-law Enforcement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a bylaw about noise from neighbours, like loud music late at night?",
        "answer": "While these specific bylaws don't detail noise regulations, municipalities typically have separate Noise Bylaws that restrict noise levels and times, especially late at night or early in the morning. You would need to consult the Town's Noise By-law or contact By-law Enforcement for specifics."

        "question": "How much does it cost to get a dog licence?",
        "answer": "Dog licensing fees are not covered in the provided fee bylaws (which focus on services, development, facilities etc.). You would need to check the Town's specific Animal Control By-law or contact the Town Clerk's department or Animal Services for current dog licence fees."

      "question": "I just bought a house on Joseph Todd Road, and the number on the house seems different from what the previous owner told me. How can I confirm my official house number?",
      "answer": "The Town assigns official building numbers through bylaws. By-law 2012-101-RD specifically updated numbers for Registered Plan 65M-3890, including Joseph Todd Road.

      "answer": "Yes, By-law 2012-101-RD states that it's the obligation of the owner or occupant to affix the assigned building number to the building. It should be placed where the Fire Department finds it satisfactory, likely meaning clearly visible from the street."

      "question": "I'm building a small shed in my backyard (less than 10 square meters). Do I still need a building permit?",
      "answer": "Generally, structures occupying an area greater than ten square meters require a building permit according to the Building Code Act, as referenced in the preamble of By-law 2012-004-BU. Since your shed is less than 10 square meters, it likely falls under the category of construction not requiring a permit (Section 7), but it's always best to confirm with the Town's Building Department, as other rules (like zoning setbacks) still apply."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the Town keep building permit records? I need information about work done on my house years ago.",
      "answer": "According to the Records Retention By-law (2009-154-RE), Building Permit records (Class Code P10) are generally kept permanently ('P') by the Building department, although there's a note about 5 years off-site storage for residential permits.

      "answer": "Yes, the Road Numbering By-law (e.g., 2016-069-RD for Plan 65M-3890) makes it the obligation of the owner or occupant to affix the assigned number to the building. It should be placed in a location satisfactory to the Fire Department for emergency response purposes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Town decide which staff members can approve things like permits or agreements?",
      "answer": "Council passes a Delegation By-law (like 2021-065-RE) which outlines specific routine powers and duties that are delegated to specific staff positions (like Directors, Managers, Clerk, Treasurer). This allows staff to handle day-to-day approvals efficiently without requiring a Council vote for every item."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can a Town Director approve a major change to a subdivision plan without Council's input?",
      "answer": "Generally, routine approvals related to subdivision plans (like endorsing notices after Council draft approval or approving designs that conform to approved plans) can be delegated to staff like the Director of Development Services under the Delegation By-law (2021-065-RE). However, significant or controversial applications, or major changes not conforming to Council's original approval, would likely still require Council's consideration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who is responsible for the Town's Emergency Plan?",
      "answer": "The Town's Emergency Response By-law (2021-017-FR, as amended by 2021-067-FR) designates the Fire Chief as the Community Emergency Management Coordinator (CEMC), responsible for the overall program. An Emergency Management Program Committee (EMPC) advises Council and reviews the plan, while the Municipal Emergency Control Group (MECG), typically led by the CAO, directs the response during an actual emergency."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if there's a major flood or storm declared an emergency in Stouffville?",
      "answer": "The Town's Emergency Response Plan (Schedule A of By-law 2021-017-FR, as amended) would be activated. The Municipal Emergency Control Group (MECG) would meet at the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to coordinate the response, manage resources, communicate with the public, and support emergency services working at the scene, following the Incident Management System (IMS)."
    },
    {
      "question": "I'm interested in serving on a Town committee, like the Heritage or Accessibility committee. How does that work?",
      "answer": "The Town establishes committees like these via by-law (e.g., 2022-131-RE). When vacancies occur, the Town advertises for members (usually residents). Applications are reviewed, and Council makes the appointments, typically for a four-year term concurrent with Council's term. There are rules about attendance, conduct, and potential term limits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I attend meetings of the Committee of Adjustment or the Appeals Committee?",
      "answer": "Yes, under the CAC Procedural By-law (part of 2022-131-RE), all Council Appointed Committee meetings, including quasi-judicial ones like the Committee of Adjustment and Appeals Committee, must be open to the public."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between a 'Delegation' and a 'Speaker' at a committee meeting?",
      "answer": "According to the CAC Procedural By-law (Appendix A of 2022-131-RE), a 'Delegation' is someone who has pre-registered to speak about a topic *not* on the meeting agenda. A 'Speaker' is someone who registers (often at the meeting) to speak about a specific item that *is* on the agenda."
    },
    {
      "question": "I received a parking ticket. Do I have to go to provincial court?",
      "answer": "No, parking tickets issued for violating designated Town by-laws (like the main parking by-law 2008-114-PR) are handled through the Town's Administrative Monetary Penalty System (AMPS), established by By-law 2023-097-LL. You can pay the penalty or request reviews through Town Screening and Hearing Officers, not the provincial court."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do I have to request a review if I get a parking penalty notice?",
      "answer": "Under the AMPS By-law (2023-097-LL), you have thirty (30) calendar days after the penalty notice is served (e.g., placed on your vehicle) to request a review by a Screening Officer. You can request an extension up to sixty (60) days if there are extenuating circumstances."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I just ignore a parking penalty notice from the Town?",
      "answer": "Ignoring the penalty notice means you are deemed to have waived your right to a review, and the penalty is affirmed. If you don't pay within the specified timeframes, late fees and MTO search fees will be added. Eventually, the Town can notify the Ministry of Transportation, which can prevent you from renewing your vehicle's licence plate sticker until the penalty and all associated fees are paid (Plate Denial)."
    },
    {
      "question": "A developer is proposing a large condo building next to my house. Will they have to consider the impact on my property?",
      "answer": "Yes. Official Plan Amendments (like 2022-058-OP for 12049 Hwy 48) and the Property Standards By-law include policies requiring consideration of impacts on adjacent properties. This often involves studies (noise, lighting, traffic, air quality), design measures (setbacks, stepbacks, height transitions, screening), and adherence to Urban Design Guidelines to ensure compatibility."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the Town encouraging specific types of businesses in the new development area near the Old Elm GO Station?",
      "answer": "Yes, OPA 155 (By-law 2023-001-OP) encourages a mix of uses including residential (apartments, townhouses), commercial (retail, restaurants, services), offices, and community facilities to create a complete, transit-supportive community. Specific policies encourage active ground-floor uses along main streets like Tenth Line."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can a business grow cannabis outdoors on farmland near Stouffville?",
      "answer": "Yes, Official Plan Amendment 157 (By-law 2022-100-OP) permits outdoor cannabis cultivation in Agricultural Areas, subject to obtaining a Health Canada license, getting a specific Zoning By-law amendment from the Town, meeting strict separation distances (1000m) from residential and other sensitive areas, and complying with regulations to mitigate nuisances like odour and light."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there restrictions on where cannabis processing facilities can be located?",
      "answer": "Yes, OPA 157 (By-law 2022-100-OP) generally permits cannabis processing only as an accessory use to cultivation in agricultural/rural areas (and only if locating in a settlement area isn't feasible). Processing as a primary use is permitted in designated Industrial Areas, subject to licensing, separation distances (1000m), municipal servicing, site plan control, and a Zoning By-law amendment."
    },
    {
      "question": "A large tree on the edge of my property might be affected by my neighbour's development application. What protection does it have?",
      "answer": "If the tree is considered a 'Mature Tree' (30cm diameter or more) and the property is in a Secondary Plan area subject to a development application, By-law 2023-060-RE applies. The developer must identify the tree, protect it during construction (Tree Protection Zone), and generally cannot remove it without Town approval and compensation (replacement trees or cash-in-lieu). If it's a 'Boundary Tree' (straddling the property line), your consent would be needed for removal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if a developer removes a protected mature tree without permission?",
      "answer": "Removing a Mature Tree without authorization under By-law 2023-060-RE is an offence. The Town can issue Orders and levy significant fines (starting at $500 per tree, potentially much higher for repeat/multiple offences). A court could also order the property owner to replant trees or undertake other rehabilitation measures."
    },
    {
      "question": "My neighbour doesn't clean up after their dog on walks. Is there a bylaw about that?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Animal Services By-law (2019-047-RE) has a 'Stoop and Scoop' rule. It requires dog owners to immediately remove and properly dispose of excrement left by their dog on any public or private property, other than their own property."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many dogs am I allowed to have at my house in Stouffville?",
      "answer": "In most residential zones, the Animal Services By-law (2019-047-RE) limits you to keeping a maximum of three (3) dogs per property or dwelling unit. The total number of all animals (including dogs) is limited to six (6) per single dwelling unit."
    },
    {
      "question": "My neighbour's dog barks constantly when left outside. What can I do?",
      "answer": "The Animal Services By-law (2019-047-RE) prohibits dog owners from allowing their dog to cause a nuisance through repetitive barking or howling that is likely to disturb inhabitants. You can report this issue to the Town's By-law Enforcement or Animal Services for investigation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any animals that are completely banned as pets in Stouffville?",
      "answer": "Yes, Section 6 of the Animal Services By-law (2019-047-RE) lists prohibited animals. This includes wild animals like monkeys, bears, large wild cats/dogs, raccoons, skunks (except domestic ferrets), elephants, certain large snakes (pythons/boas), venomous reptiles, crocodiles, and others not typically kept as domestic pets."
    },
    {
      "question": "I like feeding birds in my backyard. Is that allowed?",
      "answer": "Feeding songbirds is generally allowed under the Animal Services By-law (2019-047-RE), provided the feeder is placed high enough off the ground so it doesn't attract other wildlife (like raccoons or squirrels), it doesn't attract large flocks of pigeons, and any spilled seed is cleaned up promptly."
    },
    {
      "question": "My neighbour's pool water looks green and stagnant. Is that a violation?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Clean Yards By-law (2016-068-RE) requires owners of pools, hot tubs, or artificial ponds to maintain them in good repair. Purification systems must be maintained so the water doesn't become a health hazard. Standing water is not permitted to remain for more than 3 days."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I drain my chlorinated pool water into the storm sewer at the end of my driveway?",
      "answer": "No, not directly. The Clean Yards By-law (2016-068-RE) requires that chlorinated or chemically treated water (like from a pool or hot tub) must be dechlorinated *before* being discharged to a storm sewer."
    },
    {
      "question": "I'm worried about snow and ice falling off my neighbour's roof onto my walkway. Is there a rule about that?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Clean Yards By-law (2016-068-RE) requires property owners to remove snow and ice from roofs and eaves if it could pose a health and safety hazard to people or property below, especially in areas like walkways, driveways, and entrances."
    },
    {
      "question": "If the Town issues an order to fix something on my property under the Property Standards By-law, can I appeal it?",
      "answer": "Yes, if you receive an order under the Property Standards By-law (2018-049-RE) and disagree with it, you can appeal to the Town's Appeals Committee within 14 days of being served the order. There is a fee for the appeal. The Committee can confirm, modify, or cancel the order. Their decision (except for property standards matters) is usually final, but property standards decisions can potentially be appealed further to the Superior Court of Justice."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do I actually have to pay a parking ticket (Penalty Notice) before extra fees get added?",
      "answer": "According to By-law 2024-039-RE, you have 30 calendar days from the date you received the Penalty Notice to pay it. Fees like late payment fees or MTO search fees can be added on or after day 31."
    },
    {
      "question": "I missed the 30-day deadline to request a review of my parking ticket. Is it too late?",
      "answer": "By-law 2024-039-RE states you might still be able to request an extension from the Screening Officer within 30 days *after* the original due date, but only if you can show there were extenuating circumstances. If you don't request the review or the extension in time, the penalty is considered final."
    },
    {
      "question": "I requested a review for my parking ticket with the Screening Officer, but I disagree with their decision. What now?",
      "answer": "If you disagree with the Screening Officer's decision, By-law 2024-039-RE allows you to request a second review by a Hearing Officer. You must make this request within 30 days of the Screening Officer's decision date."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I don't show up for my scheduled Screening Review meeting for a penalty notice?",
      "answer": "According to By-law 2024-039-RE (Section 8.10), if you requested a review but fail to appear at the scheduled time (or fail to remain present), you'll be considered to have abandoned your request. You'll have to pay the original penalty amount, and you'll also be charged a Screening Non-Appearance Fee (listed as $60 in Schedule B of the amending bylaw 2024-141-RE)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I don't show up for my scheduled Hearing Review meeting?",
      "answer": "Similar to the screening review, By-law 2024-039-RE (Section 9.18) states that if you fail to appear for your Hearing Review, you're deemed to have abandoned the hearing. The Screening Officer's previous decision will be confirmed as final, and you'll have to pay a Hearing Non-Appearance Fee (listed as $60 in Schedule B of the amending bylaw 2024-141-RE) on top of the penalty."
    },
    {
      "question": "I received a penalty notice but I'm facing financial difficulties. Can the penalty be reduced?",
      "answer": "By-law 2024-039-RE (Section 12.2) allows a Screening Officer or Hearing Officer to consider reducing a penalty or extending the payment time if they are satisfied it's necessary to reduce undue hardship. You would likely need to provide proof of financial assistance (like Old Age Security, Disability Pension, OSAP, etc.)."
    },
    {
      "question": "If I don't pay my parking tickets, can the Town really stop me from renewing my licence plate sticker?",
      "answer": "Yes. According to By-law 2024-039-RE (Section 15.5), if an Administrative Penalty and any related fees are not paid within 60 days after they become due, the Town can notify the Ministry of Transportation (MTO). The MTO can then refuse to validate your vehicle permit (sticker) or issue a new one until the penalty and fees are paid. There's also an extra Plate Denial Fee added."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can unpaid Town by-law fines (like parking or noise tickets) end up on my property taxes?",
      "answer": "Yes, By-law 2024-039-RE (Section 14.4) states that if an Administrative Penalty and fees are not paid by the due date, the Town can deem the outstanding amount to be unpaid taxes and add it to the property tax roll for collection."
    },
    {
      "question": "My neighbour keeps making loud noise late at night. Can they get a ticket under the new penalty system?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Town's Noise By-law (2019-092 RE) is included as a Designated By-law in Schedule A of the Administrative Monetary Penalty System By-law (2024-039-RE). This means the Town can issue penalty notices for noise violations, with fines starting at $500 and increasing for repeat offences within a year."
    },
    {
      "question": "I saw someone parked in a Fire Route. What's the fine for that under the Town's system?",
      "answer": "Parking in a fire route is covered under the Fire Route By-law (2008-123 FR), which is included in the Administrative Monetary Penalty System By-law (2024-039-RE). According to Schedule A, the penalty for parking in a fire route is $250."
    },
    {
      "question": "I got a second parking ticket for the same thing within a few months. Is the fine higher?",
      "answer": "It depends on the specific violation. By-law 2024-039-RE (Section 5.4) and Schedule A indicate that for some offences (like noise or short-term rental violations), the penalty amount increases for second and third offences if they occur within 365 days of the previous one. For many standard parking violations listed, the penalty amount appears to stay the same for repeat offences based on the schedule provided in the bylaw."
    },
    {
      "question": "I want to build a new house in Stouffville. Do I have to pay extra fees called 'Development Charges'?",
      "answer": "Yes, generally you do. Bylaws like 2023-146-FI (Parks/Rec), 2023-147-FI (Fire), 2023-148-FI (Library), 2023-149-FI (By-law Enforcement), 2023-150-FI (Highway Services), 2023-151-FI (Wastewater), and 2023-152-FI (Water) establish development charges. These are fees collected when new development occurs (like building a house) to help pay for the increased demand on Town services caused by growth."
    },
    {
      "question": "I'm adding a small sunroom onto my existing house. Do I need to pay development charges?",
      "answer": "Likely not. The development charge bylaws (like 2023-146-FI, Section 3.5a) state that development charges are generally not imposed for an enlargement to an existing dwelling unit."
    },
    {
      "question": "I want to add a basement apartment to my single-detached house. Will I have to pay development charges?",
      "answer": "Generally, no, provided the apartment meets certain conditions. The development charge bylaws (like 2023-146-FI, Section 3.5b) exempt the creation of one or two additional dwelling units in an existing single-detached dwelling, as long as the total floor area of the new unit(s) doesn't exceed the floor area of the original house (Section 3.5f)."
    },
    {
      "question": "I'm building a new house with a separate coach house apartment in the backyard. Are there development charges on both units?",
      "answer": "Potentially only on the main house. The development charge bylaws (like 2023-146-FI, Section 3.5e and the table on Page 12) exempt the creation of a second dwelling unit in certain *new* residential buildings, including ancillary structures (like a coach house), provided the main house only contains one unit and the ancillary unit's floor area is equal to or less than the main house's floor area."
    },
    {
      "question": "I'm a developer building a new rental apartment building. Are there any breaks on development charges?",
      "answer": "Yes. The development charge bylaws (like 2023-146-FI, Page 13) offer discounts for rental housing developments with four or more units. The discount is based on the number of bedrooms: 25% reduction for units with 3+ bedrooms, 20% for 2-bedroom units, and 15% for units with fewer bedrooms."
    },
    {
      "question": "I bought an old house, planning to tear it down and build a new one. Do I get any credit on development charges for the house I'm demolishing?",
      "answer": "Yes, you likely will. The development charge bylaws (like 2023-146-FI, Section 3.10) state that if you redevelop land and demolish an existing house that was there within the last 60 months (5 years), the development charges for the new house will be reduced by an amount calculated based on the demolished unit. The credit can't be more than the total charge for the new house."
    },
    {
      "question": "When do I actually have to pay the development charges if I'm building a house?",
      "answer": "According to the development charge bylaws (like 2023-146-FI, Section 3.12), the development charge is typically calculated and payable in full on the date the first building permit is issued for your house. There are different rules for certain services in subdivisions (like water/wastewater) and for rental/institutional projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "I want to cut down a large maple tree in my backyard because I'm building a pool. It's about 40cm wide. Do I need permission?",
      "answer": "Yes, you almost certainly need permission. By-law 2023-060-RE defines a 'Mature Tree' as one with a diameter (DSH) of 30cm or greater. You cannot remove or injure a Mature Tree on private property in designated Secondary Plan areas for development purposes without Town approval, which is typically handled through the site plan or building permit process. You'll likely need an Arborist Report."
    },
    {
      "question": "The Town approved the removal of a 40cm Mature Tree for my development project. Do I have to plant new trees?",
      "answer": "Yes, compensation is required under By-law 2023-060-RE (Section 2.4d). For removing a Mature Tree between 30cm and 49cm in diameter, you are required to plant 3 replacement trees on the property. If planting isn't feasible on your property (as determined by the Town), you'll have to pay 'Cash-in-lieu Compensation' instead."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the Mature Tree I need to remove is 60cm wide? How many replacement trees are needed then?",
      "answer": "According to By-law 2023-060-RE (Section 2.4d), for Mature Trees 50cm in diameter or larger, the replacement ratio is 5:1. So, for a 60cm tree, you would need to plant 5 replacement trees, or potentially 1 replacement tree for every 10cm removed (which would be 6 trees in this case), subject to the Town Director's approval based on site conditions. Alternatively, you might pay cash-in-lieu if planting isn't feasible."
    },
    {
      "question": "There's a big tree right on the property line between my neighbour and me. Can I cut it down if they agree?",
      "answer": "If it's a Mature Tree (30cm+ diameter), you still need Town approval as per By-law 2023-060-RE, especially if it's related to development. Because it's a 'Boundary Tree', Section 2.4(e) requires you to provide the Town with written consent from the other property owner(s) as part of your application process."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the fine if I cut down a Mature Tree without getting Town approval first?",
      "answer": "By-law 2023-060-RE (Section 10.3) outlines significant penalties. For a first conviction, the fine is between $500 and $50,000. For subsequent convictions, it can be up to $100,000. Cutting down multiple trees can result in multiple fines."
    },
    {
      "question": "I have a large tree that looks dead or dying. Do I still need a permit under the Tree By-law (2023-060-RE) to remove it?",
      "answer": "While the by-law aims to protect Mature Trees, Section 2.4(b) lists conditions under which removal *may* be permitted, including if the tree is 'Dead or Dying' (defined as having 70% or more dead crown or certified by an Arborist). You would still likely need Town approval through the permit process, including potentially an Arborist's assessment confirming its condition, before removing it, especially if it's related to a development application."
    },
    {
      "question": "I'm doing construction and need to protect a tree the Town identified. What does the 'Tree Protection Zone' involve?",
      "answer": "By-law 2023-060-RE (Section 2.2d) requires a Tree Protection Zone (TPZ). This usually means putting up sturdy hoarding (at least 1.2m high, like plywood or strong fencing) around the tree. The minimum radius is typically 2.5 metres for the first 30cm of tree diameter, increasing by 0.5 metres for every additional 10cm of diameter. Nothing (materials, equipment) can go inside this zone, and it must be inspected by the Town Arborist before construction starts."
    },
    {
      "question": "I want to add about 20 cubic metres of topsoil to level my backyard (which is about 0.15 hectares). Do I need a permit?",
      "answer": "Yes, you likely do. By-law 2024-037-RE (Section 3.2b) allows properties between 0.1 and 0.2 hectares to place a maximum of 50 cubic metres of fill *once* without a permit. Since 20 cubic metres is less than 50, you might be exempt *if* this is the first time you're adding fill under this bylaw. However, Section 2.5 requires source testing for any imported fill over 30 cubic metres, so even if exempt from a permit, you might need testing if importing more than that amount. It's best to check with the Town."
    },
    {
      "question": "My neighbour is bringing in truckloads of fill for their property. How do I know if it's clean?",
      "answer": "By-law 2024-037-RE requires property owners to ensure any fill used meets provincial Site Condition Standards and is free of contaminants, waste, and invasive species (Section 2.12). If they are importing more than 30 cubic metres, they must provide the Town with chemical testing results from the source site, satisfactory to the Town's Commissioner (Section 2.5). If it's a Large Site Alteration (over 4,000 cubic metres), a detailed Fill Management Plan and likely a public meeting were required."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much fill can I bring onto my large property (over 0.5 hectares) without needing a Site Alteration Permit?",
      "answer": "According to By-law 2024-037-RE (Section 3.2d), on properties 0.5 hectares or larger, you can place a maximum of 450 cubic metres of fill *once* without needing a Site Alteration Permit. Any amount over that, or any subsequent fill placement, requires a permit."
    },
    {
      "question": "I need to store a large amount of soil (over 100 cubic metres) on my property for about 8 months while I plan a project. Is that allowed without a permit?",
      "answer": "No, that's likely considered prohibited storage under By-law 2024-037-RE (Section 2.4). Storing fill outside in amounts over 100 cubic metres for 182 days (about 6 months) or more requires that the storage be permitted by the Town's Zoning By-law and likely a Site Alteration Permit. Temporary storage (less than 182 days) might be allowed under different conditions, but storing it for 8 months would likely trigger these rules."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I change the way water drains across my property, like filling in a ditch or swale?",
      "answer": "Not without permission. By-law 2024-037-RE (Section 2.11) prohibits altering, filling, or blocking any drainage on any property without prior written approval from the Town's Commissioner."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I get caught altering my property's grade without a required permit?",
      "answer": "Under By-law 2024-037-RE, a By-law Enforcement Officer can issue an Order requiring you to stop work and/or correct the violation (Section 7.1). Failure to comply can lead to the Town doing the work at your expense and significant fines upon conviction (up to $50,000 for a first offence, potentially more for repeat or ongoing offences) (Section 10.3)."
    },
    {
      "question": "I want to speak at a Heritage Advisory Committee meeting about a local issue. How do I do that?",
      "answer": "According to the CAC Procedural By-law (2024-117-RE, Appendix A, Section 9.7), you need to submit a Deputation request form to the Council/Committee Coordinator, detailing what you want to talk about, by noon seven business days before the meeting. There's a limit of 3 deputations per meeting on items not already on the agenda."
    },
