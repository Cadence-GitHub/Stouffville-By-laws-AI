        "filtered_answer": "<h3>Car Washing Regulations in Whitchurch-Stouffville</h3>\n\n<p>Regarding washing your car in your front yard, there are several Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville by-laws that apply to water use, property maintenance, drainage, and parking. While there isn't a by-law that explicitly prohibits washing a car in your front yard, the activity is subject to various regulations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Water Use Restrictions:</strong>\n        <p>According to <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2004-087\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2004-087</a> (Water Restrictions), the use of municipal water from a hose, pipe, sprinkler, or permanent water irrigation system for the purpose of washing vehicles is restricted. These restrictions are in place between May 15th and September 30th of each year. During this period:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Even-numbered addresses may use water outdoors only on even-numbered days of the month.</li>\n            <li>Odd-numbered addresses may use water outdoors only on odd-numbered days of the month.</li>\n            <li>Outdoor water use is only permitted between the hours of 6:00 am to 10:00 am and 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>During a Stage 1 Outdoor Water Use Advisory or Stage 2 Outdoor Water Use Ban, all persons are requested or prohibited, respectively, from using municipal water for washing vehicles, with some exemptions for specific users like commercial car washes.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Water Discharge and Drainage:</strong>\n        <p><a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2018-056\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2018-056</a> (Water and Sewer) regulates discharges into the municipal sewage system, including storm sewers and land drainage works. This by-law prohibits the discharge of substances into a storm sewer or land drainage works if the discharge is not storm water or uncontaminated water. Car wash water, which typically contains soaps, detergents, and dirt, would generally not be considered storm water or uncontaminated water. Discharging such water into storm sewers or land drainage works is prohibited if it may cause interference, obstruction, damage, a hazard, or adverse effects to persons, property, vegetation, or the natural environment.</p>\n        <p>Furthermore, <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2016-068\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2016-068</a> (Regulation - Yard & Property Maintenance) requires property owners to ensure their property is graded and maintained to prevent water from ponding or creating unsafe conditions. It also states that storm water runoff should be contained within the limits of the property and not discharged onto walkways, boulevards, stairs, or neighboring lands. This principle would extend to water used for car washing, meaning the water should not run off your property onto public areas or adjacent properties.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Parking Regulations:</strong>\n        <p>If your car is parked in your front yard while being washed, <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2017-027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2017-027</a> (Parking Regulation) and <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2023-111\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2023-111</a> (Zoning Order) are relevant. <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2017-027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2017-027</a> prohibits parking a motor vehicle in an \"unauthorized area,\" which is defined as a Front Yard, Exterior Side Yard, or Side Yard, except as otherwise permitted under the Town's Comprehensive Zoning By-Law. <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2023-111\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2023-111</a> clarifies that in residential zones, motor vehicle parking in a front yard is only permitted on a driveway or a parking pad that meets specific dimension requirements.</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In summary, while you may wash your car on your property, you must adhere to the specific days and times for outdoor water use as outlined in <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2004-087\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2004-087</a>. Additionally, you must ensure that the water used for washing your car does not flow off your property onto public lands or neighboring properties, and that it does not enter the storm sewer system, as per <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2016-068\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2016-068</a> and <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2018-056\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2018-056</a>. Your vehicle must also be parked in an authorized area, such as a driveway or designated parking pad, while being washed, in accordance with <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2017-027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2017-027</a> and <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2023-111\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2023-111</a>.</p>",

The specific consequences can vary depending on the nature of the item or condition, but generally include the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Town Remedial Action:</b> The Town may undertake the removal or required work at your expense. For example, <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2008-060\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2008-060</a> states that if a boat deemed a public nuisance is not removed, the Town may remove and dispose of it. Similarly, <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=1973-043\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 1973-043</a> authorizes the Town to demolish unsafe, fire-damaged buildings if the owner fails to do so. Under <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2016-068\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2016-068</a> (Property Maintenance) and <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2018-049\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2018-049</a> (Property Standards), if an owner fails to comply with an order to correct a contravention, the Town may cause the work to be performed.

        "filtered_answer": "<h3>Swimming Pool Regulations in Whitchurch-Stouffville</h3>\n\n<p>Building a swimming pool in your backyard in the Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville involves several regulations concerning permits, enclosures, location, and drainage. Here's a summary based on the Town's by-laws:</p>\n\n<h4>Permits and Enclosure Requirements</h4>\n<p>Before excavating or constructing a swimming pool, or erecting its enclosure, you must obtain a permit. Plans for the enclosure must be submitted to the Chief Building Official, and a permit fee must be paid in accordance with the Town's Fees & Charges By-law. An encroachment permit is also required for any access across or work on Town property related to the pool or enclosure construction. If water is added to the pool during construction, a temporary enclosure must be erected and maintained until the permanent enclosure is approved.</p>\n<p>All swimming pools must be completely surrounded by an enclosure to restrict access, especially for small children. Key requirements for enclosures include:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>The enclosure must extend from the ground to a height of not less than 1.5 metres, measured on the outside.</li>\n    <li>No part of the enclosure shall consist of barbed wire, razor wire, or any device designed to conduct an electric current, or possess other dangerous characteristics.</li>\n    <li>There should be no permanent objects adjacent to the enclosure that could facilitate climbing.</li>\n    <li>No gap within or below the enclosure shall exceed 100 mm.</li>\n    <li>No part of an enclosure shall be located within 1.2 metres of the edge of the water in the swimming pool.</li>\n    <li>Enclosures should not have rails or other horizontal or diagonal bracing on the outside that would facilitate climbing.</li>\n    <li>If a building wall forms part of the enclosure, any door or gate leading into the enclosure through that wall must have a bolt latch, chain latch, or other suitable device located at least 1.5 metres above the floor or ground level.</li>\n    <li>Gates forming part of an enclosure must be of equivalent construction and height to the fence, supported on substantial hinges, and be self-closing, lockable, and self-latching. The opening device for the latch must be at the top of the gate and designed so it cannot be readily opened from the outside by small children. Gates must be kept locked at all times if a responsible person is not present and supervising the pool.</li>\n    <li>Specific construction standards are outlined for chain link and wood fences, and alternative designs must be approved by the Chief Building Official to ensure equivalent safety.</li>\n    <li>Hot tubs and spas are exempt from these enclosure requirements if a substantial, locked cover is affixed to prevent access when not in use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These enclosure regulations are detailed in <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2013-168\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2013-168</a>, Section 8.</p>\n\n<h4>Zoning and Location Requirements</h4>\n<p>A swimming pool or hot tub is generally permitted as an accessory use to a residential use. However, it is subject to specific location restrictions:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>A swimming pool or hot tub is <b>not permitted</b> in the actual front yard in any zone.</li>\n    <li>It is permitted in the actual or required rear yard, exterior side yard, or interior side yard of any lot.</li>\n    <li>The edge of the water of the swimming pool must not be located any closer than 1.2 metres to any lot line or street line.</li>\n    <li>Swimming pool pumps, filters, and heaters are permitted to project into required yards without restriction, but must be no closer than 0.6 metres from the rear lot line, interior lot line, and exterior side lot line, where the required setback is more than 0.6 metres.</li>\n    <li>Swimming pools and hot tubs are excluded from the calculation of lot coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These zoning provisions are outlined in <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2020-058\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2020-058</a>, Section 1(j) (new Section 3.42) and Section 1(e) (new Section 3.22, encroachment provision 11). Additionally, <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=1996-078\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 1996-078</a>, Section 11.(33) also states that swimming pools are not considered a building for lot coverage calculation.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that for specific Recreational Residential (RRC) zones, a swimming pool may not be permitted in the Exclusive Use Area for any Dwelling Unit. This is an exception found in <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=1998-231\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 1998-231</a>, Section 18.3(qq) A.1.xiii and <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2003-167\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2003-167</a>, Section 18.3(vv) A.1.x.</p>\n\n<h4>Drainage and Maintenance</h4>\n<p>The installation of any swimming pool or its enclosure must not alter the existing drainage pattern of the lot unless approved by the Chief Building Official. The owner is responsible for ensuring that the new drainage pattern does not negatively affect neighbouring lands.</p>\n<p>Regarding swimming pool water discharge:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>You cannot discharge swimming pool water onto any property without the consent of that property's owner.</li>\n    <li>Swimming pool water and backwash water may be discharged directly by a hose onto the street in front of the owner's property containing the swimming pool.</li>\n    <li>If discharging swimming pool water (other than backwash water) onto a street, you must first remove all organic materials from the water and allow the water to remain for a minimum of 3 days without the addition of any chemicals or algaecides.</li>\n    <li>All roof drainage or storm water, swimming pool, hot tub, or sump pump discharge from the property must be drained to prevent recurrent ponding or water entering a basement or cellar.</li>\n    <li>Such discharge must not be directed onto walkways, boulevards, stairs, or neighbouring lands.</li>\n    <li>If the water is chlorinated or chemically treated, it must be dechlorinated before being discharged to a storm sewer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, every owner of property containing a swimming pool must maintain it in good repair and working condition, and the purification system must be maintained so that the water is properly filtered and purified to prevent health hazards. These drainage and maintenance requirements are outlined in <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2006-162\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2006-162</a>, Sections 6, 7.1, 7.2, and 9.5.</p>",

Such trees shall not be removed or relocated unless permitted by the Director and/or designate (Section 1).</p>\n\n<h4>Prohibition and Conditions for Removal</h4>\n<p>The removal or cutting of Mature Trees is generally prohibited unless specific approval is granted by the Director and/or designate, typically to accommodate new development or under certain conditions such as the tree posing a hazard, being infested by disease, or being dead or dying (Section 2.4.b).</p>\n\n<h4>Enforcement Orders</h4>\n<p>In cases of contravention, a Municipal Law Enforcement Officer may issue various orders (Section 6):</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Orders to <b>correct the contravention</b>.</li>\n    <li><b>Stop work orders</b>.</li>\n    <li>Potential <b>court orders prohibiting continuation or repetition</b> of the offence.</li>\n    <li>Orders for <b>replanting or Silvicultural Treatment</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If an order is not complied with, the Town may cause the required work to be done at the expense of the person or corporation who contravened the by-law, and these expenses can be recovered in the same manner as municipal taxes (Section 6.3).</p>\n\n<h4>Penalties and Fines</h4>\n<p>Violations of <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2023-060\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2023-060</a> are subject to significant penalties (Section 7.1):</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Upon a <b>first conviction</b>, a fine of not less than <b>$500</b> and not more than <b>$50,000</b>.</li>\n    <li>Upon a <b>second or subsequent conviction</b> for the same offence, a fine of not less than <b>$2,000</b> and not more than <b>$100,000</b>.</li>\n    <li>For a <b>continuing offence</b>, a fine of not less than <b>$2,000</b> and not more than <b>$10,000 per day</b> or part of a day that the offence continues. The total of these daily fines may exceed $100,000.</li>\n    <li>For a <b>multiple offence</b>, a fine of not less than <b>$2,000</b> and not more than <b>$10,000 for each offence</b> included in the multiple offence. The total of all fines for each included offence is not limited to $100,000.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to note that for the purpose of multiple offences, the removal or cutting of <b>each Private or Mature Tree is considered a separate offence</b> (Section 7.2).</p>\n\n<h4>Replacement and Compensation</h4>\n<p>In addition to fines, the Director and/or designate is authorized to require compensation for removed Mature Trees, either through planting Replacement Trees or paying Cash-in-lieu Compensation (Section 2.4.d). The replacement ratios are:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>3:1</b> for Mature Trees 30 cm to 49 cm in DSH.</li>\n    <li><b>5:1</b> for Mature Trees 50 cm in DSH.</li>\n    <li><b>1 replacement Tree for every 10 cm in DSH</b> of Mature Tree(s) removed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If planting replacement trees on the property is not feasible, the Owner/Applicant must pay Cash-in-lieu Compensation as determined by the Town's Fees and Charges By-law (Section 2.4.d.ii). Furthermore, a court may order the replanting of any Private Tree(s) removed or the application of Silvicultural Treatment (Section 7.5).</p>",

        "filtered_answer": "<h3>Site Alteration and Property Maintenance Regulations</h3>\n<p>Paving your entire backyard with stones in the Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville is subject to regulations concerning site alteration and property maintenance. This type of activity is generally considered a \"Site Alteration\" under Town by-laws.</p>\n\n<h4>Site Alteration Permit Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n    <li><p>According to <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2024-037\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2024-037</a>, Section 2.1, no person shall undertake, cause, or permit any Site Alteration of any property within the Town without the owner first receiving a Site Alteration Permit. \"Site Alteration\" is defined in Section 1.1(jj) as any alteration to the existing grade of a property through the movement, removal, placing, or relocation of any \"Fill\".</p></li>\n    <li><p>\"Fill\" (Section 1.1(k) of <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2024-037\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2024-037</a>) includes materials such as soil, sand, clay, rock, and stone. Therefore, placing stones to pave your backyard would fall under the definition of \"Placing of Fill\" and would constitute a Site Alteration.</p></li>\n    <li><p>While <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2024-037\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2024-037</a> does provide some exemptions for minor volumes of fill without a permit (Section 3.2), paving an entire backyard would likely exceed these allowances. For example, on a property 0.1 hectares or less, a maximum of 10 cubic metres of fill is permitted once without a permit. For larger properties, the maximum volume increases, but paving an entire backyard would typically involve a significant amount of material.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Drainage and Environmental Considerations</h4>\n<ul>\n    <li><p>Any site alteration, including extensive paving, must comply with drainage regulations. <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2016-068\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2016-068</a>, Section 9.1, requires property owners to ensure their property is graded and maintained to prevent water ponding, unsafe conditions, or harm to the environment. It also states that catchbasins and swales must be installed and maintained to facilitate drainage and not impede the natural flow of stormwater.</p></li>\n    <li><p><a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2016-068\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2016-068</a>, Section 9.2, mandates that all stormwater runoff from downspouts and impervious surfaces (like a paved backyard) must be contained within the property limits until absorbed by the soil or drained to a swale, watercourse, or storm sewer.</p></li>\n    <li><p>Furthermore, <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2016-068\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2016-068</a>, Section 9.4, prohibits altering existing surface drainage patterns or creating additional stormwater runoff onto any adjacent property. Paving an entire backyard could significantly impact these drainage patterns.</p></li>\n    <li><p><a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2024-037\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2024-037</a>, Section 2.11, also explicitly states that no person shall alter, fill, or block any drainage on any property without prior written approval from the Commissioner.</p></li>\n    <li><p><a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2016-068\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2016-068</a>, Section 2.4(d), also requires that a yard be cultivated or protected by ground cover which prevents the erosion of the soil. While stones can prevent erosion, the overall impact on vegetation and natural ground cover for an entire backyard would need to be considered in the context of the by-law's intent for property maintenance.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given these regulations, it is highly probable that paving your entire backyard with stones would require a Site Alteration Permit and would need to adhere to strict drainage and environmental standards. It is recommended to contact the Town's Engineering and Public Works Department for specific guidance and to determine if your proposed project requires a permit and to ensure compliance with all applicable by-laws.</p>",

Generally, the by-law restricts the discharge of firearms within the Town, especially within \"Defined Areas\" (as described in Schedule \"A\" and illustrated in Schedule \"B\" of the by-law).

This is subject to strict conditions, including the property's location (outside or within Defined Areas), minimum land size (e.g., 10 acres within Defined Areas, 25 acres outside Defined Areas), and the condition that no bullet or shot passes over the boundary of the said lands.</li>\n    <li><b>Landowners or occupiers, or licensed hunters/trappers with prior written permission</b>, for hunting or trapping purposes, subject to specific land use (agriculture), valid Farm Business Registration numbers (within Defined Areas), and land size requirements (e.g., 25 acres outside Defined Areas).</li>\n    <li><b>Persons firing blank ammunition</b> for lawful use in film production, historical plays, or sporting events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is prohibited to discharge a firearm or bow within 200 meters of the periphery of any Educational Property used for educational purposes, except for properties used for instruction in the proper use of firearms or bows.</p>\n\n<h4>Carrying Airsoft Replicas (Weapons) in Parks</h4>\n<p>Under <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2020-087\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2020-087</a> (Parks By-Law), Section 4.1(e) explicitly states: <b>\"No person shall... carry a weapon in a park.\"</b> As airsoft replicas would likely be considered a \"weapon\" under the by-law's definition, carrying them in any park, trail, park building, or open space owned or controlled by the Town is prohibited.</p>\n\n<h4>General Information</h4>\n<p>Given the strict regulations on firearms and weapons, it is important for residents to understand that the casual use or discharge of airsoft replicas is generally prohibited in Whitchurch-Stouffville.

Zoning by-laws regulate the types of uses permitted in different areas of the Town.</p>\n\n<h4>General Permitted Uses for Restaurants</h4>\n<ul>\n    <li>Some by-laws indicate that restaurants are permitted in certain commercial and industrial zones. For example, <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=1984-073\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 1984-073</a> amends previous by-laws to allow \"Restaurant including Take-Out Restaurant\" as an additional use in a Commercial General (Cl) Zone.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=1985-149\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 1985-149</a> permits \"Restaurant and Banquet Facility\" in an Industrial Restricted Zone (M1*) on part of Park Lot 1, Registered Plan 59, with the gross floor area devoted to public use not to exceed 25% of the building's gross floor area.</li>\n    <li>For the property at 12555 Tenth Line (known as The Stouffville Country Market), <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2000-067\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2000-067</a> permits \"Restaurants, Snack Bars\" and specifies that these must be conducted and contained within a building.</li>\n    <li>Specific properties, such as 12332 Woodbine Avenue in the Community of Gormley, have zoning that explicitly permits a restaurant. <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2010-037\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2010-037</a> (Highway Commercial Zone) and <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2010-042\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2010-042</a> (General Commercial Zone) both state that the only permitted use on these lands shall be a restaurant, with or without a drive-thru component. These by-laws also specify regulatory provisions such as:\n        <ul>\n            <li>Minimum Landscaped Area between a street and parking areas or driveways: 4.0 metres</li>\n            <li>Minimum number of Parking Spaces required: 43</li>\n            <li>Minimum queue length for a restaurant with a drive-through: 20 vehicles</li>\n            <li>Maximum seating capacity of the restaurant: 55</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Specific Restrictions and Definitions</h4>\n<ul>\n    <li>It is important to note that not all areas permit restaurants. For instance, <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=1978-079\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 1978-079</a> prohibits \"Restaurants\" on lands located in part of Lot 1, Concession 4, being more particularly described as Parts 1, 6 and 7 on a plan of reference filed in the Registry Office for the Registry Division of York North as number RS 359.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2022-067\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2022-067</a> clarifies that \"Home occupations do not include ... restaurants\".

Zoning by-laws typically regulate the type of establishment and its operational characteristics (e.g., seating, parking, drive-thru), not the specific food served.</p>\n\n<p>To determine if your proposed Chinese restaurant, including Sichuan hot pot and special dishes, is permitted, you would need to identify the specific address or location within the Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville where you plan to open.

This requirement is outlined in <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2012-004\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2012-004</a>, Section 6.</p>\n\n<h3>Decks and Permit Requirements</h3>\n<p>For decks specifically, <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2012-004\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2012-004</a> provides an exception. A building permit is <b>not required</b> for residential wood decks where the surface is equal to, or less than, two feet above any point of the ground below the deck (Section 7(1)(iii)).</p>\n<p>However, if your deck's surface is <b>more than two feet above the ground</b>, or if you are building something other than a deck that requires a permit, you must obtain a permit from the Chief Building Official before starting work.</p>\n\n<h3>Consequences of Starting Work Without a Required Permit</h3>\n<p>If you commence construction for which a permit is required without first obtaining that permit, you are in contravention of the Town's by-laws. According to <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=2012-004\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 2012-004</a>, Section 33(1), any person who contravenes a provision of this by-law is guilty of an offence and is liable for a fine as established under Section 36 of the Building Code Act, 1992.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"/static/bylawViewer.html?bylaw=1971-030\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By-law 1971-030</a>, which regulates construction, alteration, or repair of buildings, states that every owner of property must obtain all applicable permits required for proposed work (Section 1.11(ii)). A breach of this by-law can result in a fine not exceeding $300.00 for each offence, exclusive of costs (Section 1.16(i)). The Magistrate may also order the offender to carry out the requirements of the by-law within a specified time. If the offender defaults, the Inspector of Buildings or any other person may be ordered to enter the premises and demolish or remove the structure, or part thereof, erected contrary to the by-law, at the expense of the offender. These expenses, with costs, are recoverable by action or distress, similar to municipal taxes (Section 1.16(ii)).</p>\n<p>It is important to ensure all necessary permits are obtained to avoid penalties and potential orders for removal or demolition at your expense.</p>",
