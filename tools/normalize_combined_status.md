# normalize_combined_status.py

## Overview

`normalize_combined_status.py` is a utility script for normalizing the `bylaw_number` fields within the `referenced_bylaws` entries of a `combined_status.json` file. It ensures that all referenced bylaw numbers follow a canonical format, using the same normalization logic as other bylaw tools in the project. The script supports dry-run mode, logs all changes, and produces an HTML report summarizing the normalization process.

## Main Features

- **Targeted Normalization:** Only normalizes the `bylaw_number` fields in the `referenced_bylaws` list of the input JSON.
- **Consistent Logic:** Uses the same filename/number parsing and normalization logic as `bylaw-json-updater.py` for consistency across the codebase.
- **Dry-Run Support:** By default, runs in dry-run mode (no files are modified). Use `--no-dry-run` to apply changes and write a new normalized JSON file.
- **Logging:** Logs all changes to both a file and the console for traceability.
- **HTML Reporting:** Generates a styled HTML report summarizing all changes made (or that would be made in dry-run mode).

## Script Flow and Logic

1. **Argument Parsing:**
   - Supports `--dry-run` (default) and `--no-dry-run` flags.

2. **Logging Setup:**
   - Logs to both a file (`normalize_combined_status.log`) and the console.

3. **JSON Processing:**
   - Loads `combined_status.json`.
   - Iterates through all `bylaw_references` and their `referenced_bylaws`.
   - For each `bylaw_number`, applies normalization logic:
     - If the normalized value differs from the original, updates the field and logs the change.

4. **Output:**
   - If not in dry-run mode, writes the normalized data to `combined_status.normalized.json`.
   - Generates an HTML report (`normalize_combined_status_report.html`) listing all changes and summary statistics.

## Use Case

This script is useful for maintaining consistency in cross-references between bylaws, especially when integrating or auditing large bylaw datasets.
